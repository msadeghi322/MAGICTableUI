Python problems and bugs:

1. recorded video is slow in playback

2. if the ball is dropped multiple times in a given trial, only the last time will be saved: 
because the file names only differ in trial number and ballescape flag, if the trial is the 
same and ball is escaped multiple times, each time the data will be rewriten. We can hope no 
one drops the ball twice


import cv2
import time


print('starting now .......')
vid = cv2.VideoCapture(1)
d = 0
ret, frame = vid.read()

while d<10:
    ret, frame = vid.read()
    filename = "file_%d.jpg"%d
    cv2.imwrite(filename, frame)
    d+=1
    time.sleep(1)
